# Mini-Reference-Guide :bookmark_tabs:
This repository represents a mini reference guide of topics I either search for often throughout my studies, topics that I needed a clearer explanation on, and/or topics that I felt were just generally important to know. This mini guide is intended to be used as a central location for the reasons listed above; it is not intended to be a full reference guide. <br>
<br>
Since I have found it is best to learn by doing, this mini guide uses C# code examples that I have created myself in a way that make sense to me.
After shuffling through my notes and erasing/re-writing these topics numerous times on my whiteboard, I figured it would be worth making this public and sharing with others. <br>

Therefore, if you found any of this useful, please consider giving it a star! :star:
